# README.md Generator !

This challenge was given by The University of Minnesota Bootcamp 

###### Generated README.md is located in 'Devlop' folder

This application utilizes Javascript, Node js, inquirer, and more, to generate a README.md file

### Description: 
Users are prompted with important questions about thier project, this application takes users answers, and initializes a README.md file _tuned_ to the users input
    
### Bugs

* GitHub Username reads after inputted email
* README.md file has no styling
* Few licenses to choose from

### Extra add-ons

###### I enjoy adding quality of life (qol) functions to assignments, time permitting. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to bring them to life on this assignment.

### Final thoughts
This has been my first couple of days using Node JS, and npm (specifically inquirer), it's sticking pretty well but I still needed alot of help on this from friends and TA's. Overall, I'm excited to keep working with _testing_ specifically and also Node.

###### Biggest struggle
Being a pretty simple challenge, my biggest struggle was actually declaring my const for the README.md at the top of index.js. Using the 'reverse' method  and really all of the methods is still a learning process for me but again, with some great help, its working as of now.
